 <h2>MYKONOS</h2>
<p>(PICTURED ABOVE)</p>
        
<p>When you think about the greek island, you may have an idea of some old place with history, wine, mules etc, Well Mykonos is nothing of that sort. It is the Ibiza, Cancun, Miami, and Barcelona places thrown together in one spot.
first, the island is rather small so by renting a scooter for 9 euros a day you have free access to all island (beware that the gas stations closes at 6pm) Therefore wherever you choose to stay is within 15 minutes of the farthest place possible (by scooter). </p>
<p> The east of the island is populated mainly by locals with many beautiful secluded beaches, so you and your companion could relax, enjoy nature at its best, take off your swimming suites and soak all the sun that you want.
The west of the island is where the action is at night, this is formed by the town of Mykonos, bunch of restaurants start opening at 11pm while the clubs will start getting the crowd at around 3am the earliest.
<p>Finally the locals all speak english rather fluent, by the nature of the island they have been in contact with people from everywhere in this world, therefore a very open minded approach to life.
I will recommend this island as the last stop in Greece, since this will represent the climax of your vacations, no other island will compare, nor you will have as much fun. </p>

<h2>PARIS</h2>

<p>The city of love. Paris is one of tho To me Paris is two things: romance and the Louvre. Romance seems to permeate the city. A walk along the Seine at night. A view of the Eiffel Tower. A view of the city from Sacré Coeur in Montmartre. Or nice romantic dinner in some small side street near Moulin Rouge. If you want to spend a romantic weekend with someone then Paris is the right place.
To especially appreciate Paris you need to have a wonderful view of the city. Here is a list of places with the best views of Paris </p>
<ul>
<li>1. Sacré Coeur in Montmartre</li>
<li>2. Notre Dame’s tower</li>
<li>3. Commanding views from the Tour Montparnasse (skyscraper in Paris)</li>
<li>4. Arc de Triomphe</li>
 </ul>
<p> You need to be selective when visiting the Louvre
Remember two things though when visiting Paris. There are long lines to climb the Eiffel Tower and to get into the Louvre. Plan accordingly, and do not forget to visit Versailles when you visit Paris. No trip to Paris is complete without visiting it.</p>

    <h2>SANTORINI</h2>
    <p>(PICTURED BELOW)</p>

    
<p>We were in a cruise and one of the stops was in Santorini. The ship stood in the middle of the sea and we had tenders to go to the island. Then we took a funicular tomgo to the top. And there it was! The island I heard talk about since I was very young, it is a city on top of a hill with a wonderful view of the ocean and the houses hanging out on the cliff.
There a lot of streets with stores that sell local stuff and also a lot of restaurants and cafes.
The most wonderul thing is just walk arround the small city! </p>

<h2>ATHENS</h2>

    </div>
 <p> Athens is the cradle of Western civilisation and the principle teacher of Democracy. What we know today is an extension of everything Greek! It has amazing antiquities, ruins, museums, knowledgeable tourist guides and a good restaurant and cafe culture. We found the Athenians abrupt on occasion, but we guess with millions of tourists trudging round your city, it could become intrusive after hundreds of years!
Things on the must do list: Acropolis Hill and Parthenon, Ancient and Roman Agora, the Plaka and Monistiraki Square, Olympic Stadium, Acropolis Museum and the Archaeological Museum of Athens. 
There are literally hundreds of things to see and do!</p>
