        <p>Christina's Countries is a travel blog by me, Christina Manolakakis.</p>
        <p>My passion for travelling started from a young age and once I began I couldn't stop. The experiences you get to go through which you wouldn't be able to from an office chair or school chair are endless.</p>
        <p>Obviously travelling comes at a great expense so it doesn't suit everyone, but once you start you can't stop so keep on buying those plane tickets to the different destinations. The beauty of travelling a country such as Europe or Asia is once your over there it is cheap to fly, train or bus.</p>
        <p>Most young adults travel on a gap year or after completing University on an Overseas Exchange(O.E) and travelling with families is very common.</p>

    <h2>My Travel Blog:</h2>
        <p> On this blog you will be able to see my favourite travel destinations with information about the city and what to do. I have been travelling around the world casually for 18 years and would love to share with fellow web users my experiences in beautiful Europe. On this blog I also have travel tips and tricks which will be helpful when going abroad.</p>
        <p>I believe travelling is one of the best experiences one can go through as they get to see things that they would never of usually gotten to. These are my top ten reasons why I beleive travelling is important for an individual:</p>
        <ul> 
        <li>Improves social and communication skills</li>
        <li>Ensures piece of mind</li>
        <li>Helps you get original and creative thoughts</li>
        <li>Broadens your horizons</li>
        <li>Enhances your tolerance for uncertainty</li>
        <li>Boosts up your confidence</li>
        <li>Gets you real life education</li>
        <li>Creates memories for a life time</li>
        <li>You always have fun</li>
        <li>Helps you get to know yourself </li>
         </ul>
        <p>I'm half Greek so speak the language which is good and that is always beneficial when visiting a country to understand the culture and language. Europe is one of the most tourist populated country in the world so it's important to plan beforehand where you want to go and what you aim to see. </p>
